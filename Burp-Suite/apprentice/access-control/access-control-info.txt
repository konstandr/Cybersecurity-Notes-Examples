Access control:
Who is authorized to do something.
In web apps: Authentication and session management
Authentication: The user is who he say he is
Session management: identifies HTTP requests that are made by the same user
Acces control: Is this user allowed to do that?

Privilege escalation
	Vertical privilege escalation
		low level user -> higher level user (simple user -> admin)
	Horizontal privilege escalation
		user -> user


Security Through Obscurity!
Lets make the admin panel like /asdas143234

Might still be leakable though

Some applications determine the user's access rights or role at login, and then store this information in a user-controllable location. This could be:

    A hidden field.
    A cookie.
    A preset query string parameter.

The application makes access control decisions based on the submitted value. For example:
https://insecure-website.com/login/home.jsp?admin=true
https://insecure-website.com/login/home.jsp?role=1

This approach is insecure because a user can modify the value and access functionality they're not authorized to, such as administrative functions. !
