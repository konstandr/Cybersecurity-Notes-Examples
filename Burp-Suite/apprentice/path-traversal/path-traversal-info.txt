Read files via path traversal
Lets say that a site loads an image with <img ... src="/loadImage?filename=01.png">
The image is stored in disk, it checks on /var/www/images/ for the image
No defence against path traversal?
Add whatever you want in path! 
For example lets go back 3 directories with /../../../AndDoWhateverYouWant
