Goal: We have 2 wordlists (One with usernames and one with passwords). Enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password and finally, access their account page

Solution:
Noticed when I tried to login it returned: Invalid username, so I get some info for the user enumeration.

When i brute forced it with intruder, i got a reply with different length than the others, for user ftp
He also got 200 error code, but for wrong password

So lets brute-force user ftp

Found different HTTP code for password michael, indicated that its his password

So
Username: ftp
Password: michael
